### Dia duit ☘️

My name is Conor.

🚀 Right now, I'm focusing on building SDKs at [Intercom](https://intercom.com).

📱 Before that, I worked on developing a new generation of SDKs at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.co.uk).

👾 Previously, I co-founded [RAID](https://raid.gg) - a creative digital agency working with game developers and publishers.
