### Dia duit ☘️

My name is Conor. I'm a developer interested in the iOS and gaming spaces. I'm passionate about building *engaging* stuff *efficiently*.

🚀 Right now, I'm focusing on building the new generation of SDKs at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.co.uk/).

👾 Previously, I co-founded [RAID](https://raid.gg) - a creative digital agency working with game developers and publishers.
